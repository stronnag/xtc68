 *              in this module.  This has been done primarily as part
 *              of the compiler to run on the EPOC operating system
 *              used by the Psion 3a pocket computer.

/******************************************************************************
 *
 *  This module handles the interface to the operating system.
 *
 *  There are only a small number of routines in the compiler that
 *  are dependent in any way on the operating environment in which
 *  the compiler is running.  All such dependencies are isolated
 *  in this source file.
 *
 *  The default versions of these routines are suitable for any
 *  Unix compatible system or any system that supports:
 *
 *  a)  The processing of command line arguments within the C startup
 *      module to set up the standard C argc/argv variables for
 *      argument passing.
 *  b)  The setup within the C startup module of the standard C I/O
 *      channels stdin,stdout and stderr.
 *  c)  Support for the following STDIO routines:
 *              vfprintf()
 *              fread()
 *
 *  Where the default routine is not satisfactory, then it will be
 *  necessary to supply alternative routines.  For examples on a
 *  typical instance of this, see the EPOC and QDOS specific parts
 *  later in this file.

/********************************************************************* EPOC */
/*
 *  The EPOC operating system is used on the Psion range of pocket
 *  computers.   These systems are based on the Intel X86 range of
 *  processors.  All programs have to conform to the small memory
 *  model (64k code + 64k data), although there are facilities for
 *  using inter-process communication and Dynamic Link Libraries to
 *  circumvent some of these restrictions.
 *
 *  The Psion SDK does provide a library (CLIB) that provides full
 *  support for all ANSI features, including those that would be
 *  required to use the DEFAULT section above.  However, if this is
 *  done, the compiler is too large to fit within the constraints of
 *  the small memory model.
 *
 *  An alternative library (PLIB) is available that is instead based
 *  around calling functions that are held in the Psion ROM.  This
 *  provides significantly smaller executables than are generated
 *  when CLIB is used.  However the functionality match to the ANSI
 *  routines is not exact, so that the emulation routines defined in
 *  this section are used instead.  Doing this, it is possible (just)
 *  to get the compiler within the small memory model.
 *
 *  NOTE.  You also need the CPOCLIB.LIB file as this contains some
 *         generic support routines used by all components within
 *         the EPOC emulation of the compilation system.
