<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H2>Overview </H2>
<P>
The RLL User Guide section is concerned with what the application
programmer has to do to make use of the RLL system.
It looks at the system from the perspective of a C application programmer,
but similar considerations would apply to using the RLL system from any
other compiled language that has RLL support implemented for it.
<P>
The first point to make is that from the perspective of the C application
programmer, no complicated tricks have to be used to make use of a RLL library
that has been provided by someone else. You write your program just as you
would normally. The only differences are:

<UL>
<LI>You are advised to define the pre-processor constant RLL_LIBS when you
    compile the program. This can be done either explicitly in your source
    via a statement of the form
    <DIR>
     <CODE>#define RLL_LIBS</CODE>
    </DIR>
    before you use any <CODE>#include</CODE> statements to bring in system
    headers, or by using the CC runtime option
    <DIR>
     <CODE>-DRLL_LIBS</CODE>
    </DIR>
    to define this symbol at runtime.
    <P>
    It is expected that most users will opt for the second of these
    approaches as it makes it easy to switch between static linking
    without using RLLs and dynamic linking using RLLs.
    <P>
<LI>Additional parameters are given to the LD linker to tell it to produce
    a program that will make use of RLL libraries, and to tell it what
    RLL libraries a program is to use.
</UL>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="Pre_Processor"></A>
<H2>RLL and the Pre-Processor</H2>

There are no explicit changes to the Pre-Processor to support the RLL system.
<P>
Having said that, many of the standard system include files need the
pre-processor symbol <CODE>RLL_LIBS</CODE> defined if you want to use
RLL versions of standard library routines.  This can be specified by
using the command line option
<DIR>
 <CODE>-DRLLLIBS</CODE>
</DIR>
to the Pre-processor.
<P>
In practise one normally does this indirectly by passing an appropriate
command line option to the <STRONG>CC</STRONG> front-end program as
discussed later.

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="Linker"></A>
<H2>RLL and the Linker</H2>
<P>
To use the RLL system you need <STRONG>LD v2.0</STRONG> or later.
The <STRONG>LD</STRONG>LD linker is supplied as part of the
C68 C ompilation system for QDOS, although it is quite capable of
being used independently of the C68 system.
<P>
When you are using RLL libraries the linker needs to be told that
you are using such libraries.   This is done vy using command line
options of the form 
<DIR>
  <CODE>-r<VAR>???</VAR></CODE>
</DIR>
where <VAR>???</VAR> specifies the name of the RLL library
to be used. The LD linker will automatically add the letters
<CODE>lib</CODE> to the start, and <CODE>_rll</CODE> to the
end in a manner that is analogous to use of the <CODE>-l</CODE>
parameter when linking without using RLLs.
Thus a command line option of<BR>
<DIR>
  <CODE>-rm</CODE>
</DIR>
would cause LD to use the library <CODE>LIBM_RLL</CODE> which is
the RLL equivalent of the <CODE>LIBM_A</CODE> library.
<P>
In practise one normally does this indirectly by passing an appropriate
command line option to the <STRONG>CC</STRONG> front-end program as
discussed later.

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="CC_Front_End"></A>
<H2>RLL and the CC Front-End</H2>
<P>
To simplify it even further for the user,
the <B>CC</B> front-end program will recognise the
<CODE>-DRLL_LIBS</CODE> option to the pre-processor or any
<CODE>-r???</CODE> option to the linker, and automatically generate
the instructions to the <B>LD</B> linker that tell it to use
the LIBC_RLL library (which is the RLL equivalent to the standard
C library LIBC_A). This is very akin to the way that the LIBC_A
library is included by default for standard user programs that
are statically linked to not use RLLs.
<P>
Not all routines that are available in the standard C68 libraries
have equivalents in the RLL versions of the same libraries.
Therefore to play safe, you should include both the RLL and
standard variants of the libraries.
The RLL version should precede the standard version of any library.
The LD linker will then select the RLL versions of the routines where
they exist, and the standard ones where they do not.
<P>
The corollary to this is that use of the RLL system is ALWAYS optional.
If you want to use RLL libraries, then you explicitly tell the system
to produce a version of your program that is to make use of RLL libraries.
If you do not do this, the default action will be to produce a version
 of the program that has all the necessary libraries routine statically
linked in so that the resultant program can be run independently of the
RLL system.
<P>
As an example, if you were going to build a program that needed routines
from both the maths libraries and the standard C library you would used
parameters of the form:
<DIR>
  <CODE>-rm -lm -rc</CODE>
</DIR>
This would search <B>LIBM_RLL</B>, the RLL version of the maths library,
to pull in whatever routines it could from there. It would then search
<B>LIBM_A</B>, the standard version of the maths library, to pull in any
maths routines that had no RLL equivalents.
Following that it would search <B>LIBC_RLL</B>, the RLL version of the
standard C library to pull in RLL versions of that type of routines.
Finally it would search <B>LIBC_A</B>, the standard version of the C library.
You could omit the <CODE>-rc</CODE> parameter from the above if you are
using the CC front-end and have used the <B>_DRLL_LIBS</B> option as
CC will then would automatically search the standard C libraries
- searching the RLL version before the non-RLL version when building
a RLL enabled program.

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="RunTime"></A>
<H2>RLL RunTime Requirements</H2>
<P>
It is worth emphasising that once a program has been linked to use
the RLL system, there are number of components that will <STRONG>need</STRONG>
to be present at runtime for it to work correctly. These are: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The THING system as the RLL system depends on it for correct
      functioning. The THING system is built into SMS2, SMSQ/E and
      Level E drivers for the Atari QDOS emulator.
      All other systems need support for the THING system to be
      explicitly loaded. However as it is also built into the HotKey
      system many such users will already have the THING system loaded.</LI>
      <P>
      For those who do not already have THING support via one of the above
      software components, the file THING_REXT that is supplied with the
      C68 system can be used to fulfil this purpose.
      If you are not sure how to load such a file,
      look at the sample BOOT file provided on the C68 RUNTIME 2 disk
      which shows a suitable example.
      <P>
  <LI>The <A HREF="RLMUSER.HTM">Runtime Library Manager</A> (RLM).</LI>
      <P>
  <LI>Any RLL libraries specified during the LD link phase
      (LIBM_RLL and LIBC_RLL in the example given above).
      These can be preloaded in the BOOT file, or dynamically loaded
      as required. How this is done is discussed in the
      <A HREF="rlmuser.htm">RLM User Guide</A>.</LI>
</UL>

If all these conditions are satisfied then the RLL system will function
in a completely transparent manner, and the user will be unaware of its
presence.
