<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H2>Overview </H2>
<P>
It is not envisaged that the average C programmer will ever need
to be directly concerned with the details of how a system interfaces
to the Runtime Link Manager. This capability is intended primarily
for use by a systems level programmer who is trying to interface a
new programming language to the RLM. </P>
<P>
The calls that the RLM supports allow all phases of its operation
to be directly controlled. This should make it easy to interface a
new system to the RLM. </P>
<P>
If you are a C programmer using the C68 system, then you do not have
to worry about this aspect of the RLM at all. The necessary calls to
link C68 programs to the RLM are issued automatically from the
C startup module if you specified that you wanted to use RLL libraries
when you built your program.</P>
<P>
The RLM is implemented using the THING system. The calls to the
RLM therefore use the standard mechanisms for interfacing to the
THING system. Some systems such as SMSQ, SMSQ/E, SMS2 or Atari
QL Emulators with Level E drivers have built in support for the
THING system. On other systems it needs to be loaded explicitly.
It is worth noting that if your system has support for the Hotkey
system, then you do already have THING support loaded (this means
that users of QPAC2 will always have such support loaded).
If the system does not satisfy any of the above criteria then the
THING support code needs to be loaded explicitly. C68 users will
have the THING_REXT file on the RUNTIME 2 disk to provide such
support.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="Standard_Definitions"></A>
<H2>Standard Definitions </H2>
<P>
If you are going to write code that interfaces to the RLL or
RLM at this level, then you should use the standard include
files provided. </P>
<P>
For C programmers, this is done using a statement of the form:</P>

<DIR>
<CODE><P>#include &lt;rll.h&gt;</CODE>
</DIR>
<P>
while for assembler programmers the equivalent is</P>
<DIR>
<CODE>include rll_in</CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
These include files are themselves used internally within th
e components used to implement the RLL system, so using them
in your own code will ensure consistency. </P>

<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="Finding_RLM"></A>
<H2>Finding the RLM </H2>
<P>
The first thing that one has to do is to check that the RLM is
 actually loaded into memory, and if so at what address.
 This is done by using assembler of the form: </P>
<DIR>
<CODE>
<PRE>rlmname dc.b 0,3,"RLM",0 
rlmaddr dc.l 0 
rlmver  dc.l 0
 
moveq  #sms.uthg,d0    ; Use THING call 
moveq  #-1,d1          ; this job 
moveq  #-1,d3          ; infinite timeout 
lea    rlmname$pc),a0  ; name of THING 
bsr    _ThingTrap      ; ... do it 
tst.l  d0              ; did it work? 
bne    suicide         ; ... NO, abandon 
move.l a0,rlmaddr      ; save address 
move.l d3,rlmver       ; save version </PRE>
</CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
In the above example, the <CODE>_ThingTrap</CODE> routine
is used to invoke the <CODE>sms.uthg</CODE> system call.
This is because on systems that have direct operating support
for THINGS, the relevant operating system calls are available
as TRAP #1 calls, while on other systems these calls have to be
performed via a vector. The routine <CODE>_ThingTrap</CODE> is
a way of automatically using the TRAP #1 call if it is available,
or using the vector method otherwise - but in both cases passing
exactly the same parameters.
The source of the <CODE>_ThingTrap</CODE> routine is provided as
part of the source of the C68 LIBC_A libraries.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="Calling_RLM"></A>
<H2>Calling the RLM</H2>
<P>
The calls to the RLM are made with a value in d0 indicating the
operation required, with any additional parameters passed on the
stack in C style. The parameters passed for each operation type
will be as defined for that particular operation.</P>
<P>
In assembler, a typical call sequence will be something of the form:</P>
<DIR>
<CODE><PRE>.... set up any parameters required 
moveq   #OperationCode,d0 
move.l  rlmaddr$pc),a0 
jsr 12  $a0) 
lea     ??$sp),sp   ; remove stack parameters 
tst.l   d0          ; did it work? 
bne     ???         ; ... NO, do something </PRE></CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
Note that it is the responsibility of the calling code to tidy
the stack and remove the parameters that were passed on the stack
when the call has completed. </P>

<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="Freeing_RLM"></A>
<H2>Freeing the RLM </H2>
<P>
When you have finished using the RLM, then you should immediately
free it.</P>
<P>
In Assembler this would look like: </P>
<DIR>
<CODE><PRE>moveq #sms.fthg,d0 
moveq #-1,d1 
lea   rlmname,a1 
jsr   _ThingTrap </PRE></CODE>
</DIR>

<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="Simplified_Interface"></A>
<H2>Simplified Interface to the RLM </H2>
<P>
The C68 standard C library contains routines which simplifies the
handling of the RLM. The above complexities of finding, calling
and releasing the RLM are hidden behind a single function call.
This simplified interface does the following every time: </P>

<UL>
  <LI>Finds the RLM THING </LI>
  <LI>Make the requested call.</LI>
  <LI>Free the RLM thing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The simplified assembler interface is provided by the <CODE>CallRLM()</CODE> function. This used by as follows: </P>
<DIR>
<CODE><PRE>.... set up parameters for the RLM call 
moveq #OperationCode,d0 ; Set the operation type 
jsr   CallRLM           ; go and do it 
lea   ??$sp),sp         ; remove stack params  
tst.l d0                ; did call work? 
bne   ???               ; ... NO, do something </PRE></CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
The interface for the C programmer consists of a named call
corresponding to each of the possible RLM functions (which
are then mapped internally in the library onto the
<CODE>CallRLM()</CODE> function mentioned above).
If you are going to use these versions of the calls,
then the C program should include a statement of the form:</P>
<DIR>
<CODE><P>#include &lt;rll.h&gt; </P></CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
to get the appropriate prototype definitions included.
You can then simply use statements such as: </P>
<DIR>
<CODE><P>RLM_SetDebugDir("ram1_"); </P></CODE>
</DIR>

<P>
from within the C program. This C interface is also, of course,
available to the assembler programmer. The full definition of
all these calls in C terms follows later in this document.</P>
<P>
Note, however, that a program cannot issue a call to the RLM
to do relocation on itself using this simplified interface.
This is because the C compiler does not produce position
independent code, so until the relocation has happened no
C library routines can be called.</P>

<P><HR><P>

<A NAME="RLM_Operation"></A>
<H2>RLM Operation </H2>
<P>
In operation the Runtime Library Manager will be installed as a
shareable utility thing with a single entry point at offset %10
relative to its Thing Header. The first parameter must always be
a word containing an operation code to indicate the call function
required. A QDOS/SMS error code is returned in d0.l. Parameters
are passed on the calling jobs stack. Calling jobs should have at
least 1000 bytes of stack space available + any stack space used
by RLL init routines $thus maximum total usage 2000 bytes). </P>
<P>
The RLM is initialised by the conventional LRESPR call.
The SuperBasic command INIT_RLM is also linked in to permit the
user to re-link the RLM in the event of accidental Thing removal.
The RLM is not currently ROMable as it includes C code that needs
runtime relocation. It could be rewritten in assembler to remove
this restriction.</P>
<P>
SuperBasic extensions are provided to permit the user to change
defaults etc. This interface was described in Section 2 of this
document. The low-level assembler calls to change the global
environment of the RLM are intended for front-end programs and
not client jobs requiring linking. </P>
<P>
Libraries can be loaded explicitly by the user or as required by
the RLM $and automatically removed when not in use). A default
library directory is defined internally to the RLM as the primary
search path for RLLs. In addition the LIB_ subdirectory of the
PROG_USE directory, and the DATA_USE directories would also be
searched.</P>

  linking the calling code to the RLLs that it is going to use.</P>
  <P>
  The list of RLLs required is taken from the RLIB section of RLL BSS
  area of the calling code. If any RLLs are specified by the calling

  <P>
  It is possible for one job to link the code of another by passing
  the job ID of the code owner. If this is done steps must be taken
  to guard against the unexpected removal of the code owner,
  for example the calling job being owned by the code owner. </P>

<H4>Description</H4>
<DIR>
  This call is a companion to the
  <A HREF="#RLM_LINKRLL"><CODE>RLM_LinkRLL()</CODE></A> call.
  It will unlink a specified program from the given RLL.
  If the unload timeout for this RLL is reached, then it will
  be automatically unloaded. Similarly if there are any dependent
  RLLs that reach their unload timeout, then they would also be
  unloaded.
  <P>
  This call is not expected to be used very often as in most cases
  the <A HREF="#RLM_LINKCODE"><CODE>RLM_LinkCode()</CODE></A> call
  would be used instead to link all RLL(s) associated with a
  particular program, and they would never be explicitly unlinked.
  Instead the program would terminate itself, and the RLM would
  automatically tidy up the state of the loaded RLLs as a result.
  <P>
  The main purpose of this call is to provide a method of dynamically
  linking in different RLLs at runtime according to some external
  criteria. This system needs to be used with great care as any
  attempt to execute code that has not yet been linked to its target
  RLL is certain to cause a program to crash, and is quite likely to
  crash the whole system.
  <P>
  It is possible for one job to unlink the code of another by passing
  the job ID of the code owner. If this is done steps must be taken
  to guard against the unexpected removal of the code owner,
  for example the calling job being owned by the code owner.
  <P>
  Note that the default action of the LD linker is to set up the
  program so that the BSS_XREF area is to be re-used as UDATA 
  (Unitialised Data) purposes once a program has finished its

<LI>RLLs with a finite timeout or a dependency on another RLL are
    loaded into transient program space. Is is so that they can be
    allocated a job ID to permit the THING system to mark them as
    users of other THINGs. The job names given to RLLs loaded into
    transient program space will always be "RLL " followed by the
    RLL name. RLLs that have no dependencies and infinite timeout
    are loaded into the Common Heap.
<LI>RLLs that are cascade loaded will be given the same timeout
    value as applied to the orginally loaded RLL.

  The timeout delay is used for deciding when to unload libraries
  that are loaded dynamically. A negative value is treated as
  infinite delay. This timeout delay does not apply to libraries
  that are loaded statically as in this case the delay is explicitly
  stated in the load call.
  <P>
  It is also normally inadvisable to specify too small a value for
  this timeout. If you do, you may find that the library is continually
  being unloaded just before you are about to use it again.
