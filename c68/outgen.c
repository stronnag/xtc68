 * History:
 *
 * 1989   starting an 68000 C compiler, starting with material
 *        originally by M. Brandt
 * 1990   68000 C compiler further bug fixes
 *        started i386 port (December)
 * 1991   i386 port finished (January)
 *        further corrections in the front end and in the 68000
 *        code generator.
 *        The next port will be a SPARC port
